# The ALX Project: API advanced
-------------

The goal of this project is to get more familiar with __complex API interactions__, 
including __handling pagination__, __authentication__, and __advanced querying techniques__.
An __API (Application Programming Interface)__ is a set of rules and protocols that 
allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. 
In this project, advanced API concepts would be discussed.
A great API to use for some practice is the __Reddit API__. 
There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, 
and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented. 


## Project Requirements:computer_mouse::computer:

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS` using __python3__ (`version 3.4.3`)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- All codes should use the `PEP 8 style`
- All files must be executable
- The length of all files will be tested using `wc`
- All modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- You must use the Requests module for sending HTTP requests to the `Reddit API`
