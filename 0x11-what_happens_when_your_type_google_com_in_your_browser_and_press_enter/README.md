# The ALX Project 0x11: What Happens When You Type "google.com" in Your Browser and Press Enter

Welcome to Project 0x11! In this project, we will explore the behind-the-scenes process that occurs when you type "google.com" in your web browser and hit Enter. We will dive into the various steps involved in translating your input into a fully rendered webpage. This README.md file will provide a detailed explanation of the project, including instructions, requirements, and additional resources.

## Project Description

When you type a URL like "google.com" in your browser and press Enter, it triggers a series of events that allow you to access and view the desired webpage. This project aims to understand the step-by-step process that takes place behind the scenes.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of this process, we will cover topics such as:

- DNS Resolution: Translating the domain name into an IP address.
- HTTP Protocol: Establishing a connection and sending HTTP requests.
- Server Processing: Handling the request and generating a response.
- Rendering the Webpage: Displaying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Through this project, you will develop a solid understanding of how the internet functions and how web browsers interact with servers to retrieve and display web content.
