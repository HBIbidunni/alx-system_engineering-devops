# Loops, conditions and parsing
-------
Here, in this __ALX project__ the key learnings include:
* How to create __SSH keys__(both `public` and `private` SSH keys).
* How `Shellcheck` works as a tool.
* The advantages of using __#!/usr/bin/env bash__  over __#!/bin/bash__.
* How to use `while`, `until` and `for` loops.
* How to use `if`, `else`, `elif` and `case` condition statements.
* How to use the `cut` command.
* What are __files__ and other __comparison operators__ , and how to use them.

## Project Requirements :briefcase:
* All files will be interpreted on __Ubuntu 20.04 LTS__.
* All files should end with a new line.
* All Bash script files must be executable.
* All Bash scripts must pass `Shellcheck` (__version 0.7.0__) without any error.
* The first line of all  Bash scripts should be exactly __#!/usr/bin/env bash__.
* The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the scripts are doing.
